    Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both hor
        izontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser

        sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.
